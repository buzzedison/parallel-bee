## **The Power in Consistency:**

Do you agree that it is hard to be consistent?

**You set goals and find it difficult to achieve them.**

Maybe you want to learn to code, you take the first step but can’t seem to find the courage to take another step. **Naturally human nature is against consistency but with time it is something you become if you keep trying and not give up. It becomes your nature.**

**Learning the power of focus can help.**

**Can you focus on one thing for 5 minutes?**

Yes, sometimes we struggle to focus on one thing for 5 minutes.

* Can you take 2-3 hours once a week just to think, plan and restrategize. No checking your phones, emails, twitter, tiktok etc.
* What do you want to accomplish each day? Set a tone today for tomorrow so that you are not faced with so much confusion tomorrow.
* Take a nap. I must confess I don’t do this as much as I would love to. When I do, I wake up so refreshed and able to do more. I feel like I just recharged my batteries each time.
* Keep your promises- Don’t promise to do something and give yourself 1000 excuses why you are unable to. If you promise to send that email or call do it. It builds consistency.
* Reward yourself for getting things done. Subscribe to Netflix, Amazon prime or HBO, order a good meal, buy something nice for yourself. “You won’t come and come and come and kii yourself”

I love writing, I work 3-4 jobs, I teach people how to code, I coach businesses and budding entrepreneurs. I finally started learning to play the guitar after more than five years of owning one.

Focus, and making sure I do what I say I will do has been really instrumental to being able to juggle all of these things and not go crazy. Lol

Someone once asked if I ever sleep. Yes! I still get 8 hours of sleep believe it or not. I can be up till 2 am sometimes but then I don’t get up till about 10am with my phone on silence.
